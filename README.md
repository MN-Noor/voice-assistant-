monday hackathon project to make changes in/tables by giving voice commands
in this project the gcp.py file is used to transcribe the voice commands into text by using google cloud sttkey you can also use whisper for that
and for  converting text to  sql  the codex model is used and to record audio and use this in your local system you can use file recorder.py 
and but if you want to record audio from browser you can use flask file app.py and templates folder
